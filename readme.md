This is a test for tough-cookie memory leaks.

There is a super super super tiny leak going on right now, I have no idea what might be causing it.

1. Checkout the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. It will launch a window, click play to run the code.
5. Go to the profile tab, and take a heap snapshot.
6. Go back to the terminal, hit enter.
7. Wait for it to finish, then take another snapshot and compare.
8. Hit enter in the terminal to kill the debugger.
